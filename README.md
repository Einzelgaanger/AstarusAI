# Astarus AI Platform

Astarus AI is a marketing site for a memory-augmented AI platform. The project is built with Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-url-here.com
VITE_API_MODEL=mistral
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

**Note:** 
- If API environment variables are not set, the application will use default values.
- Supabase variables are required for user authentication and chat storage. The app will work without them, but users won't be able to sign up or save their chats.

### Supabase Setup

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Supabase setup is **required** for spaces functionality. Without it, users cannot create spaces.

1. Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to your project settings and copy:
   - Project URL (for `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`)
   - Anon/Public key (for `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`)
3. **Create your `.env` file** in the project root:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-url.com
   VITE_API_MODEL=mistral
   ```
4. **Restart your development server** after creating/updating `.env` file
5. In your Supabase SQL Editor, run the **entire** `supabase-schema.sql` file to create the necessary tables:
   - `chats` - stores user chat sessions
   - `messages` - stores individual messages in chats
   - `user_memory` - stores user-specific memory/data
   - `spaces` - stores AI spaces (required for space creation)
   - `space_members` - stores space memberships and invitations
6. The schema includes Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure users can only access their own data

**Troubleshooting:** If you can't create spaces, see `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for detailed help.

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

The development server runs at `http://localhost:5000` by default (configured in `vite.config.ts`).

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start a local development server with hot reloading
- `npm run build` – create an optimized production build in `dist`
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally

## Project Structure

- `src/App.tsx` wires the shared layout, routing, and global styles
- `src/pages/` contains top-level routes such as `Index`, `Technology`, and `Team`
- `src/components/` provides UI sections and reusable elements
- `src/assets/` includes imagery used throughout the site
- `public/` is served statically by Vite at the project root

## Deployment

The project outputs static assets once built. Deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to any static hosting platform (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.).
